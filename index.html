    <h2>About Me:</h2>

<p>I believe, people can only get creative in a job if they are really interested in it. The wants of doing something different than the rest of the mob.
  Our education system is critically failing at it. We need to adobt to a new way of education called adaptive education system.

</p>
<p> Where a student can choose different streams in which he is interested to find any kind of cross-over. Jobs should be given based on skill set rather  on Degrees. It is te responsible of the state to make sure more uptodate information are fed to the students rather than old and outdated one.</p>
